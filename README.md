# XYZ Reader Udacity Project

5th project of the Udacity [Android Developer Nanodegree](https://de.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801).
The project aims to learn about [Material Design](https://material.io/design/) and how to apply it to an existing app.
[Starter code](https://github.com/udacity/xyz-reader-starter-code) is provided, which uses deprecated components and manual approaches to achieve Material Design.
I updated the code to use Android Architecture Components and the Design Support Library.
Additionally, I use Dagger 2 for dependency injection.

Work in progress...
